# myProjects
repository of all my stuff, mostly school work

Note: all my C/C++ stuff is lost in either high school computers or my pc's virtual box, which got deleted when my pc got corrupted
summaries of all that code:

High school stuff:
a bunch of games, including a couple text adventures, real-time maze thing with enemies/keys, basic 2D maze, thing where a stickman blocks incoming projectiles using WASD to move a shield, and a 3D maze:
OOOO  OOOO  OOOO
O xO  O XO  O OO
O OO  O OO  O  O
OOOO  OOOO  OOOO
//middle is you+your maze, left/right are above/below you, if there's an open space at your x,y cords, it shows an x and you can teleport to the lower level
Also made merge sort with linked lists, some circular includes and object inheritance and recursive solutions projects, and other stuff I don't remember...
